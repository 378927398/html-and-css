                Clans are groups of players who join to support each other,
                either materially (donating troops) or verbally (giving advice).
                Players can join clans once they rebuild the special Clan Castle
                building early on. A major component of the gameplay of Clash of
                Clans is clans facing off against one another in the "clan
                wars". Clan leaders and co-leaders can begin wars against other
                clans. Each clan is then given one "preparation day" and one
                "war day." When a player attacks a member of the opposing clan,
                they receive stars based upon the amount of destruction they
                cause to the opponent's base, 50% damage or more gives 1 star,
                destroying the townhall also gives 1 star and destroying the
                entire base gives the remaining third star.

                Clash of Clans is an online multiplayer game in which players
                form communities called clans, train troops, and attack other
                players to earn resources. There are four currencies or
                resources in the game.[3] Gold and elixir can be used to build
                and upgrade defenses and traps that protect the player's village
                from other players' attacks and to build and upgrade buildings.
                Elixir and dark elixir are also used to upgrade troops and
                spells. In past, they were also used to train the troops but now
                training is free.[9] Gems are the premium currency.[3] Attacks
                are rated on a three-star scale and have a maximum timed length
                of three minutes.[3]

                To earn and store gold and elixir, players must build gold mines
                and gold storages and elixir collectors and elixir storages,
                respectively. Elixir is used to train new troops, carry out
                research in the laboratory to upgrade troops, and to build and
                upgrade certain buildings, mostly pertaining to buildings used
                in attacking another player's base. Gold is used to build
                defensive buildings and to upgrade the town hall, which allows
                access to more buildings and higher levels for existing
                buildings.
